# Social Media Ad Performance Dashboard 📊

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze social media advertising data to identify key trends and performance metrics that can help optimize marketing strategies.

Using **Microsoft Power BI**, I transformed raw data into an interactive dashboard that visualizes campaign performance across various dimensions such as demographics, platforms, and timeframes.
